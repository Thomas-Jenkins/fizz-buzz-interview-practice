// For this assignment I know I will need a for loop to check each number from 1 to 100. I will need three functions, One to check if the number is divisable by
// 3 which will result in fizz being printed to the screen, one to check if the number is divisable by 5 which will result in buzz being printed to the screen 
// and finally one to check if the number is divisable by both 3 and 5 which will result in fizzbuzz being printed tot he screen. If none of those are true, then 
// the number itself will be printed tot he screen.
